### Eat-Da-Burger

For this project, we were tasked to create a log of uneaten and eaten burgers using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM. This project follows an MVC design patter using Node and MySQL to query and route data into the app. Handlebars is used to generate the HTML.

## How to Run the App

To run the app, you just need to visit the deployed page.
Simply devour any burgers that remain, or you can add your own burger. After you've hit "devour", it'll make its way to the devour list.

## Built With
* HTML
* CSS
* Materialize
* Javascript
* Node.js
* Express.js
* Handlebars
* MySQL

## Other Notes
This was made for the UCLA Coding Bootcamp 2020.

## Known Issues
App is able to take in new burgers and add them to the database, however they are not dynamically printing on the page.
